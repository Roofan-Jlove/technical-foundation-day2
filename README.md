2. Content Management and Product Data (Sanity CMS)
•	Positioned centrally in the diagram, connected directly to the Frontend.
•	Manages:
o	Product data (menu items, descriptions, prices, images).
o	Content (blogs, promotions, restaurant information).
•	Data flows from Sanity CMS to the Frontend for rendering dynamic content.
3. Authentication (Clerk)
•	Integrated with the Frontend.
•	Handles user authentication and authorization.
•	Enables features like:
o	User login/signup.
o	Protected routes (e.g., cart and checkout pages).
4. Payment Gateway (Stripe)
•	Connected to the Frontend.
•	Handles payment processing during checkout.
•	Data flow:
o	Frontend sends payment details to Stripe.
o	Stripe processes the payment and returns a success/failure response.
5. Third-Party APIs (ShipEngine)
•	Positioned below the Frontend layer.
•	Used for shipment tracking post-payment.
•	Data flow:
o	Frontend sends shipment details to ShipEngine.
o	ShipEngine returns tracking information to the Frontend.

Data Flow
1.	Frontend ↔ Sanity CMS:
o	Frontend fetches product data and content from Sanity CMS to render pages dynamically.
2.	Frontend ↔ Clerk:
o	Frontend interacts with Clerk for user authentication and session management.
3.	Frontend ↔ Stripe:
o	After authentication, the Frontend sends payment details to Stripe for processing.
4.	Frontend ↔ ShipEngine:
o	Post-payment, the Frontend sends shipment details to ShipEngine and receives tracking information.
